JobPilot automates all of this.\n\nGiven only free-form text from the user, JobPilot:\n\n✔ Builds or updates a structured professional profile\n✔ Retrieves job postings from a vector database\n✔ Filters and ranks opportunities using agents\n✔ Summarizes job descriptions clearly for the user\n✔ Generates tailored resumes and cover letters\n✔ Produces complete application packages for selected jobs\n\nThe entire pipeline runs autonomously through coordinated agents.\n\n🧠 Architecture Summary\n\nJobPilot follows a modular multi-agent design, where each agent handles a focused skillset:\n\n1. Orchestrator Agent\n\n   The system’s “brain.”\n   Routes all information, manages tools, oversees sequencing, and enforces system rules.\n   It never performs work itself — it delegates everything to sub-agents.\n\n2. Job Search Agent (Agent 1)\n\n   Retrieves and ranks relevant job postings via ChromaDB.\n   Performs:\n\n   Dense semantic search\n\n   Duplicate/rejection filtering\n\n   Job scoring (via job_filter_agent)\n\n   Final ranking (via rank_job_tool)\n\n3. Application Builder Agent (Agent 2)\n\n   For every selected job, generates:\n\n   A tailored resume\n\n   A tailored cover letter\n   using its dedicated sub-agents.\n\n4. Supporting Agents\n\n   profile_builder_agent — parses/updates the user’s background\n\n   job_filter_agent — evaluates user–job fit\n\n   job_summarizer_agent — transforms job data into clear summaries\n\n   resume_generator_agent — produces job-specific resumes\n\n   cover_letter_generator_agent — produces job-specific cover letters\n\n   All agents share unified schemas and follow strict input/output constraints.\n\n📦 Data & Vector Search Layer\n\nJobPilot uses ChromaDB as its semantic retrieval engine, storing job postings with structured metadata and vector embeddings.\nThis layer powers the entire job-search experience inside the multi-agent system.\n\nThis notebook includes:\n\n✔ Standalone ingestion pipeline (ingest_jobs.py)\n\n✔ HTML extraction using BeautifulSoup\n\n✔ Normalization into the unified JOB_DETAILS_SCHEMA\n\n✔ Embedding generation (local SentenceTransformers or Gemini embeddings)\n\n✔ Persistent ChromaDB storage for all job postings\n\n✔ Semantic retrieval used exclusively by the Job Search Agent\n\nThis forms the foundation for fast, intelligent job discovery.\n\n🛠️ Core Technologies Used\n\nJobPilot combines modern agent tooling with vector search and structured data pipelines:\n\n✔ Google ADK — agents, tools, sessions, runners\n\n✔ Gemini 2.5 Flash / Flash-Lite — reasoning, classification, generation\n\n✔ ChromaDB — persistent vector store with metadata\n\n✔ SentenceTransformers — optional local embeddings (ingestion)\n\n✔ SQLite (DatabaseSessionService) — long-term session memory\n\n✔ BeautifulSoup4 — structured HTML parsing\n\n✔ Python, Pydantic, asyncio — core runtime, validation, async execution\n\n✔ All components run natively in the Kaggle Notebook environment\n\n📘 Notebook Structure\n\nThis notebook is organized into a clean, modular workflow:\n\n✔ Overview & Documentation\n\n✔ Global Agent Instructions (instructions.py)\n\n✔ Unified Schemas (schemas.py)\n\n✔ ChromaDB Ingestion Pipeline (ingest_jobs.py)\n\n✔ Main JobPilot System (main.py)\n\n✔ Agents\n\n✔ Tool wiring\n\n✔ Session memory\n\n✔ Gemini models\n\n✔ Vector search integration\n\n✔ Debug, Test & Run Utilities\n\nEvery section is self-contained, clearly commented, and easy to follow.\n\n🚀 What JobPilot Enables\n\nJobPilot provides a fully autonomous job-search and application-writing experience:\n\n✔ Automatic profile understanding\n\n✔ Real-time semantic job retrieval\n\n✔ Smart filtering and ranking based on user preferences and rejection memory\n\n✔ Concise, readable job summaries\n\n✔ Tailored resumes for each selected role\n\n✔ Tailored cover letters for each selected role\n\n✔ Full application packages ready to deliver\n\n✔ Persistent memory ensures long-term personalization\n\n✔ Modular architecture (future-ready for APIs, scraping, additional agents)\n\nThis system showcases how multi-agent orchestration, vector search, and LLM reasoning can work together seamlessly in a single unified pipeline.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 📜 JobPilot — Agent Instructions Module\n\nThis cell writes the complete **instructions.py** file used by JobPilot’s multi-agent system.  \nIt contains **all behavioral specifications** for every agent in the architecture:\n\n- **Orchestrator Agent**\n- **Profile Builder Agent**\n- **Job Search Agent**\n- **Job Filter Agent**\n- **Job Summarizer Agent**\n- **Resume Generator Agent**\n- **Cover Letter Generator Agent**\n- **Application Builder Agent**\n\nThese instructions define:\n\n- Each agent’s responsibilities  \n- Exactly how agents call tools and sub-agents  \n- Required input/output schemas  \n- Memory usage rules  \n- Valid reasoning paths and strict prohibitions  \n- Structure of JobPilot’s end-to-end workflow  \n\nThis file is essentially the *“constitution”* of the JobPilot system — the rules every agent must follow to maintain consistent, predictable, and testable behavior throughout the application pipeline.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile /kaggle/working/instructions.py\ninstructions_json = {\n    \"orchestrator_agent\": \"\"\"\nYou are the **Orchestrator Agent** for JobPilot — the top-level coordinator of a multi-agent job search and application-building system.\n\nYou NEVER perform the work yourself.  \nYou ALWAYS call tools and other agents.\nTool responses are Python dicts — not strings — and must be passed as dicts into other agents.\n\n\nThis agent follows a strict sequence of actions:\n\n1.

HANDLE USER FEEDBACK\n==============================================================\n\nFrom user reply, extract:\n\n- selected_jobs: the jobs the user wants to apply to\n- rejection_reasons: reasons for rejecting the others (if any)\n\nUpdate long-term memory:\n\n- Store or update \"rejection_memory\" with the user’s rejection reasons.\n- Keep \"user_profile\" as is unless the user explicitly updated it via new profile text.\n\n\n==============================================================\n5. TRIGGER APPLICATION BUILDER AGENT (Agent 2)\n==============================================================\n\nWhen the user has selected jobs to apply to, call **application_builder_agent** with a dict with these fields:\n\n\n    \"selected_jobs\": [...], \n    \"user_profile\": <PROFILE_SCHEMA object>\n\n\nIt returns a dict with this field:\n\n    \"applications\": [\n        {\n            \"job_id\": \"<string>\",\n            \"resume_text\": \"<string>\",\n            \"cover_letter_text\": \"<string>\"\n        },\n        ...\n    ]\n\n\n\n==============================================================\n6. RETURN FINAL OUTPUT\n==============================================================\n\nYou MUST output and give the user ALL generated application documents to the user, grouped by job_id.\n\n\n\n==============================================================\nRULES\n==============================================================\n\n- ALWAYS call profile_builder_agent first using the raw user_text.\n- NEVER modify the profile manually — only profile_builder_agent may update it.\n- NEVER create job details manually.\n- NEVER generate resumes or cover letters — use application_builder_agent.\n- Long-term memory keys you rely on:\n    - The 3 schemas: PROFILE_SCHEMA, JOB_DETAILS_SCHEMA, JOB_FILTER_OUTPUT_SCHEMA\n    - \"user_profile\"\n    - \"rejection_memory\"\n- Session memory:\n    - Temporary job lists, search results, and intermediate data ONLY.\n\nYour role is sequencing and routing — not doing the semantic work yourself.\n\n==============================================================\nTOOL / AGENT CALLING CONVENTIONS\n==============================================================\n\nWhen calling tools or

Services & Infrastructure**\n- Loads API keys and environment variables  \n- Initializes the **SQLite-backed DatabaseSessionService** (for persistent sessions & memory)  \n- Connects to the **shared ChromaDB vector store** that contains job postings  \n- Registers the chosen embedding function for semantic search  \n\n### **2. Tooling for the Agents**\nDefines ADK-compliant tools including:\n- `chroma_query_tool` → semantic job search  \n- `rank_job_tool` → deterministic ranking of job candidates  \n\nThese tools are used internally by the Job Search Agent.\n\n### **3. All LLM Agents**\nInitializes every JobPilot agent using Gemini models:\n- **Orchestrator Agent** (top-level controller)  \n- **Profile Builder Agent**  \n- **Job Search Agent**  \n- **Job Filter Agent**  \n- **Job Summarizer Agent**  \n- **Resume Generator Agent**  \n- **Cover Letter Generator Agent**  \n- **Application Builder Agent**\n\nEach agent receives its corresponding instruction block from `instructions.py`, ensuring consistent behavior.\n\n### **4. Agent → Tool Wiring**\nAttaches tools to the correct agents following ADK conventions:\n- Orchestrator uses: profile builder → job search → summarizer → application builder  \n- Job Search Agent uses: `chroma_query_tool`, `job_filter_agent`, `rank_job_tool`  \n- Application Builder uses: resume + cover letter generators  \n\n### **5. Runner Setup**\nCreates an ADK `Runner` with:\n- the orchestrator as the root agent  \n- global logging  \n- persistent session handling  \n\nThis is what enables multi-turn state, memory, and a reproducible job search workflow.\n\n### **6. Optional Debug Entry Point**\nThe `main()` coroutine at the bottom demonstrates a **full end-to-end test run** using a sample user profile.  \nRunning it triggers the entire JobPilot pipeline:\n1. Profile extraction  \n2. Job database lookup  \n3. Filtering & ranking  \n4. Summarization  \n5. Application package generation  \n\n---\n\nThis module is the **heart of the JobPilot system** — the part that ties every agent, tool, schema, memory, and vector-search capability together into one cohesive multi-agent application.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#%%writefile /kaggle/working/main.py\nimport os\nimport json\nimport hashlib\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any\nfrom
